# GSoC Proposal 2016

My SymEngine GSoC Proposal

[SymEngine](https://www.github.com/symengine/symengine) is a C++ library for Symbolic computations which is to act as a fast core for [Sympy](https://www.github.com/sympy/sympy).

My proposal was to develop a Polynomial Manipulation module for SymEngine focusing specifically on factoring polynomials in finite fields and solving various types polynomials functions.
